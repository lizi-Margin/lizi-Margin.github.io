我是孙浩程，北京邮电大学大数据科学与技术专业本科生。

I am interested in how agents learn to make decisions by interacting with their environment.
I work with reinforcement learning and LLM-based agents, applying them to air combat simulations and game AI.
I enjoy building realistic environments and agent systems using tools like Unreal Engine.
