<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a student in the School of Computer Science at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

I am interested in how agents learn to make decisions by interacting with their environment.
I work with reinforcement learning and LLM-based agents, applying them to air combat simulations and game AI.
I enjoy building realistic environments and agent systems using tools like Unreal Engine.
